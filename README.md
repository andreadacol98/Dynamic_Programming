# Dynamic_Programming
The goal of this programming exercise was to was to deliver a package with a drone as quickly as possible when subject to probabilistic uncertainty.
## Problem set up
The drone operates in a discretized world of M x N cells and its dynamics at a certain time step are modelled through three state variables, namely its position on the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>-axis and a binary variable telling if the UAV is carrying the package or not.
At time step <i>k</i> the system evolves in the following way:

## Breadth/Depth first search

As a first exercise we are going to implement Breadth/Depth first search and Iterative Deepening.
